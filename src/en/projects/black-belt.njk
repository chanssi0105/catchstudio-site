        <p class="p-sec__body" data-reveal-body>
          The initial draft included both opening information and program details, but lacked clear design guidelines and an organized information hierarchy. As a result, it was unclear which messages should be prioritized. This highlighted the need to clearly define the purpose of the leaflet and to redesign the overall structure and visual flow around the core message and a clear path toward consultation inquiries.
